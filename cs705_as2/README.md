# CS705 Assignment 2

### Q1.) Model-checking LTL properties using SPIN

Uses only 3 process, because of state space explosion (N=4, States=1e+06).

#### ltl properties:

``` c
/* Safety Property: Multiple processes cannot enter the critical section simultaneously. */
ltl safety { [](ncrit <= 1) }

/* Liveness Property: If a process is waiting, it will eventually enter the critical section. */
ltl liveness1_pN {[](pos[_pid] > 0 -> <> (ncrit == 1))}
/* Always, if the process is in the waiting state (flag[_pid] > 0), then eventually (<>) it will reach the critical section (ncrit == 1) */

/* Liveness Property: Any process not in the critical section will eventually enter it. */
ltl liveness2_pN {[](pos[_pid] == 0 -> <> (ncrit == 1))}
/* Always, if a process is not in crit sect (flag[_pid] == 0), then eventually (<>) it will enter the critical section (ncrit == 1) */
```
ltl property for each process as `_pid` is not defined outside of the model.

#### Results:
##### safety:
``` bash

There were no errors from the `safety` ltl property, meaning that at no point in the execution was the safety property violated.
The model is cyclic and continuously executes the processes with `goto again`, hence `-end-` is never reached.

No errors (`errors: 0`) from `liveness1_p2`, meaning process 2 is guaranteed to eventually enter the critical section when it attempts to.
**State Space Search**:
``` c
22825 states, stored (51125 visited)
46604 states, matched
97729 transitions (= visited+matched)
```
These values indicate that a larger portion of the state space was explored for this property, showing that the verification examined a wide range of paths to ensure process 2 isn't starved.

No errors (`errors: 0`) from `liveness2_p2`, meaning process 2 is guaranteed to eventually enter the critical section, even if it isn't actively trying to at the moment.
**State Space Search**:
``` c
22825 states, stored (51125 visited)
46604 states, matched
97729 transitions (= visited+matched)
```
These values indicate that a larger portion of the state space was explored for this property, showing that the verification examined a wide range of paths to ensure process 2 isn't starved.

#### General
No atomic steps: The model doesnâ€™t include any atomic operations, as we are using control structures.

Unreached states in `user` process: The implicit termination state (`-end-` state) is never reached. This is due to the process loops using goto again indefinitely.

#### Full results
Results for the other processes.

### Q2.) SMT solvers for hardware verification

**Majority voter equation**:

``` python
Y = (!ABC) + (A!BC) + (AB!C) + (ABC)
```

**Equation**:

``` python
Y' = AB + BC + AC
```

**Result**:

``` bash
admin@debian:~/repo/cs705_assignments$ python -u "/home/admin/repo/cs705_assignments/cs705_as2/Q2/smt_sovler.py"
Equations are equivalent
```

**Simplification steps to prove `!ABC + A!BC + AB!C + ABC == BC + AB + AC`**:

Majority voter equation: `(!ABC) + (A!BC) + (AB!C) + (ABC)`

1. distributive law: `ABC + !ABC = BC(!A + A)`

`BC(!A + A) + A!BC + AB!C`

2. complement law: `(!A + A) = 1`

`BC + A!BC + AB!C`

3. distributive law: `BC + A!BC = C(A!B + B)`

`C(A!B + B) + AB!C`

4. absorption law: `A!B + B = A + B`

`C(A + B) + AB!C`

5. expand: `C(A + B) = AC + BC`

`AC + BC + AB!C`

6. distributive law: `AC + AB!C = A(B!C + C)`

`BC + A(B!C + C)`

7. absorption law: `A(B!C + C) = A(B + C)`

`BC + A(B + C)`

8. expand: `A(B + C) = AB + AC`
   
`BC + AB + AC`
